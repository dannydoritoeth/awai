# HubSpot Lead Scoring System

## Overview
The AI-based lead scoring system integrates with HubSpot to automatically score leads based on their profile, behavior, and engagement data. The system generates dynamic lead scores that help the sales team prioritize high-potential leads and improve conversion rates.

## Features

### 1. Scoring Components
The lead score (0-100) is calculated using four weighted factors:
- **Lead Fit (30%)**: Match to ideal client profile
  - Industry alignment
  - Company size
  - Geographic location
  - Lead source
  - Lifecycle stage

- **Engagement (30%)**: Interaction metrics
  - Email opens and replies
  - Meeting attendance
  - Call completion
  - Total engagement count

- **Outcome (20%)**: Historical success patterns
  - Deal win rate
  - Average deal size
  - Sales cycle length
  - Industry performance

- **Recency (20%)**: Time-based activity
  - Last engagement date
  - Activity frequency
  - Response time

### 2. Priority Levels
Leads are categorized into three priority levels:
- **High Priority** (80-100): Immediate follow-up required
- **Medium Priority** (50-79): Regular nurturing needed
- **Low Priority** (0-49): Long-term nurturing

### 3. HubSpot Integration
The system updates the following custom fields in HubSpot:
- `ai_lead_score`: Numerical score (0-100)
- `ai_lead_fit`: Category (High/Medium/Low)
- `ai_close_probability`: Likelihood of closing (0-100%)
- `ai_next_best_action`: Recommended action (Follow-up/Nurture/Close)

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Scores are updated within 5 minutes of new activity
- Automatic workflow triggers for high-priority leads
- Bi-directional data sync with HubSpot
