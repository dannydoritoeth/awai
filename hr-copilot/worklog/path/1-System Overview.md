## NSW Government RAG Career Intelligence System — Overview

### Purpose

To build a public-facing, AI-powered career exploration and workforce mobility platform using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This will help individuals navigate NSW Government careers and provide departments with workforce insights and planning tools.

### Core Components

#### Role Pages

* Summary of responsibilities, required capabilities, skills, classification, and agency/division.
* Links to related roles and transitions.

#### Transition Pages

* Explain how to move from one role to another.
* Highlights gaps and readiness, with AI-generated development plans.

#### General Role Ontology

* Groups similar roles across agencies.
* Enables shared transitions and planning across variants.

#### Skills and Capabilities Pages

* Describe what each skill/capability is.
* Show where it is required and how to develop it.

#### Career Pathways Graph

* Visual progression paths.
* Lateral, vertical, and pivot opportunities.

#### Faceted Discovery

* Filter content by:

  * Taxonomy (function or theme)
  * Region
  * Division
  * Classification level
  * Skill/capability

#### Public UX Entry Points

* Start with Role / Person / Insight / Conversation
* Search or filter entry via homepage

#### Sidebar Dynamics

* Filter panel or history depending on context
* Dynamically changes across pages

#### RAG Engine

* Index job ads, roles, skills, capabilities, transitions.
* Embed and retrieve content semantically.
* Use prompt templates to generate natural language outputs.

### Use Cases

* Career development for public sector staff
* Internal mobility and retention
* Department-level planning
* Public awareness of role opportunities

### Optional Add-Ons

* Resume matching
* Talent dashboards
* Inclusion insights (e.g. First Nations, remote roles)
* Predictive vacancy or gap detection

### Next Steps

* Finalize data sources
* Wireframe all major page types
* Implement caching and generation workflows
* Pilot across a lead agency (e.g. DCCEEW)
