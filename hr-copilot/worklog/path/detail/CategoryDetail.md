now we want to modify how the detail pages are done. Lets start with the taxonomy detail page. 

Left Filter Panel
When we are on a detail page then it will have the relevant filters applied on the left. 
If we started at the very top Taxonomy list and clicked a taxonomy then on the left panel that one is selected and we are filtering the roles to those that are linked to this taxonomy item. 

Detail & Links - Right Panel
What we want is for detail pages to have the info & links etc. on a right panel. The title of the category can remain in the center but all the other info needs to go to the right panel. 

AI Insights - Center Top
In the middle then we will have a new panel for AI insights. This panel will have an initial general summary. 

Roles List
This is where we will be displaying roles that are filtered. This can be the roles list page if we can add that here?
