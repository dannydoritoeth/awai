## 🎯 Metric 8: Support Equitable Talent Decisions

### 🌐 Workflow Goal

Ensure that all talent processes—such as hiring, development, and mobility—are fair, transparent, and based on consistent, capability-aligned criteria.

### 🧩 Actions & Descriptions

#### `getJobReadiness` (Implemented in candidate.ts)

* **Purpose:** Objectively assess how prepared a person is for a target role
* **Input:** `profileId`, `roleId`
* **Output:** Readiness score + breakdown by capability areas
* **Used by:** Hiring panels, internal job recommendations

#### `getCapabilityGaps` (Implemented in candidate.ts)

* **Purpose:** Identify gaps between an individual's current capabilities and the target role
* **Input:** `profileId`, `roleId`
* **Output:** List of capabilities to develop
* **Used by:** L\&D planning, development support, equity of opportunity

#### `getProfileContext` (Implemented in candidate.ts)

* **Purpose:** Provide a holistic, structured view of an employee’s skills, experience, qualifications, and capabilities
* **Input:** `profileId`
* **Output:** Profile summary including both verified and inferred capabilities
* **Used by:** Panel reviewers, profile comparisons, equitable search

#### `getAnalyticsSummary` (Implemented in analyst.ts)

* **Purpose:** Monitor equity outcomes and participation across programs or opportunities
* **Input:** Filter by cohort or group (e.g. gender, region, job family)
* **Output:** Participation and readiness stats
* **Used by:** Workforce equity dashboards

#### `getCapabilityReadinessScores` *(New - Required)*

* **Purpose:** Generate fair, structured readiness scores for succession and role shortlisting
* **Input:** `profileId`, `roleId`
* **Output:** Quantified readiness with consistent logic
* **Used by:** Shortlist automation, fairness reviews

### 👥 Users

* Panel Members
* P\&C and Talent Leads
* HR Business Partners

### 🔗 Combined Workflow Logic

1. Use `getProfileContext` to standardise candidate comparisons
2. Apply `getJobReadiness` and `getCapabilityGaps` for role-specific insight
3. Generate cohort comparisons or reports with `getAnalyticsSummary`
4. For structured processes, run `getCapabilityReadinessScores` for objectivity

### 📊 KPIs for Success

* % of shortlists using objective readiness scores
* Equity in internal application outcomes (offer rates, progression)
* Uptake of L\&D by underrepresented groups
* Satisfaction with fairness of process (via pulse surveys)
* Reduction in bias-flagged decisions or complaints

### 🤖 Autonomous Agent Workflow (Optional Add-On)

#### 🎯 Role: Equity Assurance Agent

Monitors talent actions and outcomes to detect disparities, recommend interventions, and suggest opportunities to underrepresented or overlooked employees.

#### 🧠 Triggers (Agent Monitored)

* Internal campaigns or transitions underway
* Uneven application or success rates by group
* Missed match opportunities for high-potential but underrepresented profiles

#### 🔄 Agent Workflow Logic

1. Track outcomes from hiring, upskilling, and mobility workflows
2. Compare across groups using `getAnalyticsSummary`
3. Flag imbalances or recurring exclusion patterns
4. Suggest matching actions via `getJobReadiness` or `getCapabilityReadinessScores`
5. Nudge HR or manager to engage overlooked candidates

#### 📌 Notes

* Enhances transparency and inclusion without requiring full audits
* Helps uncover hidden barriers or missed opportunities

### ✅ Outcome

* Embeds fairness into decision making
* Increases participation from underrepresented groups
