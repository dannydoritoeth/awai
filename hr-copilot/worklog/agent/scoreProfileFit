// ðŸ›  Cursor Work Request: scoreProfileFit(profileId, roleId)

// Objective:
// Implement the scoreProfileFit(profileId, roleId) function to calculate a numerical and semantic fit score between a Profile and a Role based on capability and skill alignment, as well as semantic similarity using embeddings. This score will be used for ranking and readiness evaluation within the MCP.

// âœ… Requirements

// - Be lightweight and fast (ideally one SQL call with joins).
// - Be pure (no side effects).
// - This will be used in the MCP to get the context of a profile.
// - It shouldn't be an edge function, but a shared library function.
// - Refactor code as necessary to avoid DRY violations.
// - Leverage embeddings for semantic similarity scoring.

// Function Signature:
async function scoreProfileFit(profileId: string, roleId: string): Promise<ProfileFitScore> {}

// Expected Output Structure:
type ProfileFitScore = {
  profileId: string;
  roleId: string;
  score: number; // 0â€“100
  semanticScore: number; // 0-100, based on embedding similarity
  combinedScore: number; // 0-100, weighted average of score and semanticScore
  summary: string; // e.g., "Strong semantic match (85%) with 4 of 5 capabilities aligned"
  matchedCapabilities?: string[];
  missingCapabilities?: string[];
  matchedSkills?: string[];
  missingSkills?: string[];
  semanticInsights?: {
    roleAlignment: number; // Cosine similarity between profile and role embeddings
    companyAlignment?: number; // Optional: similarity with company culture
    divisionAlignment?: number; // Optional: similarity with division focus
  };
};

// ðŸ§± Source Tables
// - profiles (with embedding)
// - roles (with embedding)
// - companies (with embedding)
// - divisions (with embedding)
// - profile_capabilities and profile_skills
// - role_capabilities and role_skills
// - capabilities (with embedding)
// - skills (with embedding)

// ðŸ§  Notes
// - Base the traditional score on % of required capabilities and skills matched (40% weight)
// - Calculate semantic score using embedding similarities (60% weight):
//   * Direct profile-to-role embedding similarity
//   * Aggregated capability embedding similarities
//   * Aggregated skill embedding similarities
//   * Company/division culture fit (if available)
// - Use vector_cosine_ops for similarity calculations
// - Consider caching frequently accessed embeddings
// - Weights may be adjusted based on role requirements
// - Should be consistent with other scoring logic (e.g., rateJobFit, getMatchingProfiles)
// - Consider reusing utility methods for gap comparison and semantic matching
