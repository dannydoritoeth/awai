# 🧠 Work Request: Add Right Panel Match Explorer to Chat View

## Objective

Enable users to interactively explore, compare, and discuss matched candidate profiles and roles when they are suggested by the ai. This enhancement adds a right-hand panel for match exploration within the chat session, with actionable AI tools.

Currently there is Profile or Role Details. There should be a new tab next to it: "Matches"

## ✅ Part 1: Chat Panel UI (Frontend)

### 📌 Step 1.1: Identifying Matches to Display

* When loading chat_messages the messages where user = assistant and response_data != null are what we need to check 
* This has the records that we need to display and then will use to prompt the for questions about it

### 📌 Step 1.2: Add Right-Side “Matches” Panel

* Display match panel beside the ongoing chat session
* It can be either roles or profiles
* Show list with:
  * Name
  * Match percentage
  * Mini tags (e.g., “Ready now”, “Development needed”)
  * Relevant Buttons for Profile or Role: `Explain Match`, `Development Path`, `Compare`

### 📌 Step 2.2: Action Buttons — Trigger Chat Prompts

* When a user clicks an action button:

  * Send a post request to the chat edge function with the  structured prompt into chat as system message and any additional context in the body of the request:
    * **Explain Match** → “Explain why \[Name] is a good fit for \[Role Title]”
    * **Development Path** → “What would \[Name] need to work on to succeed in this role?”
    * **Compare** → “Compare \[Name A] to \[Name B] for \[Role Title]”
* AI returns reasoning based on capability overlap/gaps

## ✅ Part 3: Backend Support (Supabase Edge Function - `mcp-loop`)

### 📌 Step 3.1: Extend Role Actions

* Add support for the following actions:

  * `explainProfileRoleMatch(profile_id, role_id)`
  * `generateDevelopmentPlan(profile_id, role_id)`
  * `compareProfilesForRole(profile_a, profile_b, role_id)`

### 📌 Step 3.2: Provide Prompt Templates

* Each action should use a consistent prompt structure:

**System Prompt:**

> You are a workforce analyst helping assess candidate fit for roles based on capabilities. Always refer to the NSW Capability Framework.

**User Prompts:**

* “Explain why \[Name] is a good fit for \[Role Title].”
* “What would \[Name] need to improve to succeed in \[Role Title]?”
* “Compare \[Name A] and \[Name B] for \[Role Title].”

## ✅ Output

* Match exploration and AI discussion are co-located
* Matches are actionable, not just listed
* Encourages deeper workforce decisions through natural language + structure
